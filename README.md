## Functional Details
The client procures goods in bulk from wholesalers in Varanasi and distributes them to local shopkeepers in Azamgarh. The range of goods includes dry fruits, cosmetics, ayurvedic products, chocolates, worship items, cooking oil, spices, and other grocery products.  

Suppliers provide goods to the client, which are transported to the warehouse. It is critical to verify that the quantity of goods received matches the supplied quantity; discrepancies are the driverâ€™s responsibility. Therefore, the system maintains comprehensive driver data such as name, license number, phone number, address, and Aadhaar number.  

Similarly, the client distributes goods to buyers through transport vehicles, and the same verification and driver responsibility principles apply. Buyer data includes GST number, phone number, and trade name.  

The system also tracks **loans**, as the client often takes items from suppliers or gives items to buyers without immediate payment. For each buyer and supplier, the application stores loan details, including the loan rate.  

Each item record includes:
- Unique ID  
- Name  
- Weight  
- Company name  
- Quantity available in stock  
- MRP  
- Cost price
- Selling price  
- Tax rate

For every purchase, the system records:
- Bill number  
- Supplier GST number  
- Date  
- Driver details  
- List of items received (with name, quantity, price, discount, and amount)

For every sale, the system records:
- Bill number  
- Buyer GST number  
- Date  
- Driver details  
- List of items sold (with name, quantity, price, discount, and amount)
